            <h1>Types of Data Structures</h1>
            <p>Data Structures an be classified into <b>Primitive data structures</b> and <b>Non-Primitive data
                    structures</b> <br>
                <b>Primitive Data Types</b>: A primitive data type is pre-defined by the programming language. The size
                and type of variable values are specified, and it has no additional methods. <br>
                <b>Non-Primitive Data Types</b>: These data types are not actually defined by the programming language
                but are created by the programmer.

            <h2>Primitive Data Structures</h2>
            <p>
                Primitive data structures consist of the numbers and the characters which are
                built in programs. These can be manipulated or operated directly by the
                machine level instructions. Basic data types such as Integer, Real, Character,
                and Boolean come under primitive data structures. These data types are also
                known as simple data types because they consist of characters that cannot be
                divided.
            </p>
            <h2> Non-primitive Data Structures</h2>
            <p>
                Non-primitive data structures are those that are derived from primitive data structures.
                These data structures cannot be operated or manipulated directly by the machine level
                instructions. They focus on formation of a set of data elements that is either
                homogeneous (same data type) or heterogeneous (different data type).
                These are further divided into linear and non-linear data structure based on the structure
                and arrangement of data.
            </p>
            <h2>Linear Data Structure</h2>
            <p>
                A data structure that maintains a linear relationship among its elements is called a linear
                data structure. Here, the data is arranged in a linear fashion. But in the memory, the
                arrangement may not be sequential.

                    <h2>Array</h2>
                    <p>Array, in general, refers to an orderly arrangement of data elements. Array is a type of
                        data structure that stores data elements in adjacent locations. Array is considered as linear data structure that stores elements of same data types. Hence, it is also called as a linear homogenous data structure.</p>
